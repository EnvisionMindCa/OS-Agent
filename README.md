# llm-backend

This project provides a simple async interface to interact with an Ollama model
and demonstrates basic tool usage. Chat histories are stored in a local SQLite
database using Peewee. Histories are persisted per user and session so
conversations can be resumed with context. One example tool is included:

* **execute_terminal** â€“ Executes a shell command inside a persistent Linux VM
  with network access. Use it to read uploaded documents under ``/data`` or run
  other commands. Output from ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` is captured and
  returned. The VM is created when a chat session starts and reused for all
  subsequent tool calls.

The application injects a robust system prompt on each request. The prompt
guides the model to plan tool usage, execute commands sequentially and
verify results before replying. It is **not** stored in the chat history but is
provided at runtime so the assistant can orchestrate tool calls in sequence to
fulfil the user's request reliably.

## Usage

```bash
python run.py
```

The script will instruct the model to run a simple shell command and print the result. Conversations are automatically persisted to `chat.db` and are now associated with a user and session.

Uploaded files are stored under the `uploads` directory and mounted inside the VM at `/data`. Call ``upload_document`` on the chat session to make a file available to the model:

```python
async with ChatSession() as chat:
    path_in_vm = chat.upload_document("path/to/file.pdf")
    reply = await chat.chat(f"Summarize {path_in_vm}")
```

When using the Discord bot, attach one or more text files to a message to
upload them automatically. The bot responds with the location of each document
inside the VM so they can be referenced in subsequent prompts.

## API Server

An HTTP API is provided using FastAPI. Run the server with:

```bash
python server.py
```

Send a POST request to `/chat` with the fields `user`, `session` and `prompt` to
receive the assistant's reply. Conversation history is persisted in
`chat.db`. Use the `/reset` endpoint to clear previous messages for a session.

## Docker

A Dockerfile is provided to run the Discord bot along with an Ollama server. The image installs Ollama, pulls the LLM and embedding models, and starts both the server and the bot.

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t llm-discord-bot .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -e DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token llm-discord-bot
```

The environment variables `OLLAMA_MODEL` and `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL` can be set at build or run time to specify which models to download.

## Frontend

A simple React application is included under `frontend` for interacting with the API.
Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` to point to the backend (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`).
Build the production bundle with `npm run build`.
